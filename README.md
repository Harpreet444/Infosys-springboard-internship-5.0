# ðŸŽ¥ Object Detection Using Surveillance Video

Welcome to my **Infosys Springboard Internship 5.0** project repository! ðŸš€ This project focuses on **Object Detection Using Surveillance Video** by leveraging the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model and **Streamlit** for the graphical user interface (GUI).  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to detect objects in real-time or pre-recorded surveillance videos using the **YOLO model**. The application provides an **intuitive GUI** built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload videos, perform object detection, and view the results.

### âœ¨ Key Features  
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Detect objects in live surveillance feeds or uploaded videos.  
- **YOLO Model:** Utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for fast and accurate object detection.  
- **Streamlit GUI:** Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for uploading videos and viewing detection results.  
- **Multi-Class Detection:** Capable of detecting multiple object classes (e.g., people, vehicles, animals, etc.).
